# iOSCppCallback
A C++11-based implementation of C++ to Objective-C callbacks.

This framework is a demonstration of using C++11 function pointer
objects in conjunction with Objective-C bridging to pass a pointer
to an NSObject down to C++, and then execute the callback in an
Objective-C context. A protocol is used to enforce the callback
interface.
